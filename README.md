# Taylor Swift Sentiment Analysis Using Twitter
This project will involve collecting tweets containing the keyphrase, *'Taylor Swift'* or mention her Twitter, *@taylorswift13* and analyzing these tweets as being positive, negative, or neutral.

**Research Question:** How has the public perception of Taylor Swift changed over the years (i.e. overall positive, negative, or neutral)?

**Hypothesis:** I think that for the brief period before the official announcement of the Eras Tour on November 1st, 2022, the overall sentiment is positive. The Ticketmaster Verified Fan Presale for the Eras Tour began November 15th, 2022; due to major complications with the presale, I think public sentiment shifted negatively.

The opening shows of the tour were in Glendale, AZ on March 17th and 18th and the tour has received glowing reviews. As a result, I think public sentiment became more positive.
