# Taylor Swift Sentiment Analysis Using Twitter
This project will involve collecting tweets containing the keyphrase, *'Taylor Swift'* or mention her Twitter, *@taylorswift13* and analyzing these tweets as being positive, negative, or neutral.

**Research Question:** How has the public perception of Taylor Swift changed over the years (i.e. overall positive, negative, or neutral)?

**Hypothesis:** Prior to 2016, I feel like the public opinion of her was neutral. I say this since she obviously had fans saying positive things about her, but she has recieved negative commentary about her dating life. In 2016, she was publically 'cancelled' and this cancellation was spearheaded by Kim Kardashian and Kim's now ex-husband, Kanye West. Hence, I feel like the public perception became quite negative in 2016 up until 2017. After 2017, Taylor began releasing music again and I feel like her reputation has mostly recovered and has become more positive.
